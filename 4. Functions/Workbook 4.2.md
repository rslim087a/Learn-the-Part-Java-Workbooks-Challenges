## Tip the waiter.
Your bill was $53.50. It's polite to tip the waiter 15% of your bill.

## Task 1 - Write a function
-------------------------

You will write a function that does this task.

- Function name: `tipTheWaiter`. It calculates a tip and prints it.

```java
/**
 *  Function name: tipTheWaiter - calculates a tip and prints it. <-----
 *  @param bill (double).
 *
 * Inside the function:
 *  1. Calculates a tip that's 15 percent of the bill you paid.
 *  2. Prints: your service was wonderful! Please, accept this tip: $<tip>
 *
 */
```

- Parameters: The function takes one parameter named `bill` of type `double`.

```java
/**
 *  Function name: tipTheWaiter - calculates a tip and prints it.
 *  @param bill (double). <-----
 *
 *  Inside the function:
 *   1. Calculates a tip that's 15 percent of the bill you paid.
 *   2. Prints: your service was wonderful! Please, accept this tip: $<tip>
 *
 */
```

- Return value: the comment says nothing about a return value. So, you can assume the function is `void`.

- Inside the function, implement the following logic:

```java
/**
 *  Function name: tipTheWaiter - calculates a tip and prints it.
 *  @param bill (double).
 *
 *  Inside the function:   <-----
 *   1. Calculates a tip that's 15 percent of the bill you paid.
 *   2. Prints: your service was wonderful! Please, accept this tip: $<tip>
 *
 */
```

Task 2 - Call the function
--------------------------

Call the function from `main()`.

Run your code.
--------------
```
Waiter: I hope you enjoyed your meal!
```

```
Thank you!
Your service was wonderful! Please, accept this tip: $8.025
```
## Visualizing the Runtime

After you solve this workbook, I still recommend watching the video solution on Udemy.

It will show you how to visualize the runtime using Visual Studio Code.
